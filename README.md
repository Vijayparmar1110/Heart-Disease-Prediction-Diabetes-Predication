# Heart Disease & Diabetes Prediction System

This project includes two machine learning-based systems to predict **heart disease** and **diabetes**. The systems are powered by well-trained machine learning models, served via **FastAPI** for API integration, and feature an interactive user interface built with **Streamlit**.

## Features

### Heart Disease Prediction
- **Input Parameters**: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on key clinical parameters.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained using logistic regression and other supervised learning techniques.
- **Accurate Predictions**: Optimized for high performance and reliability.

### Diabetes Prediction
- **Input Parameters**: Predicts the probability of diabetes based on medical and lifestyle data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses advanced classification algorithms for robust predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Streamlined data input with clear outputs for better decision-making.

### API Integration
- **FastAPI**: Exposes APIs for both prediction systems for easy integration with other platforms.
- **Endpoints**: Provide real-time predictions using JSON payloads.
